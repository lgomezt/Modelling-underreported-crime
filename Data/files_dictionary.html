	<li><strong>grilla_bogota.csv:&nbsp;</strong>is a data frame with 1638 rows and 5 columns in which each row described one grid of Bogot&aacute;. The difference between this file and grilla_bogota2.csv is that this file is used to plot Figure 9 which includes the rural area of the city. Something that is removed in our analysis due to the low density of crime in this zone.&nbsp;This file is created in the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/lgomezt/Modelling-underreported-crime/blob/main/Scripts/1_preprocess_data/3_create_grid.ipynb">3_create_grid.ipynb</a> script of our repository.</li>
	<li><strong>grilla_bogota2.csv:&nbsp;</strong>is a data frame with&nbsp;1008 rows and 10 columns in which each row described one grid of Bogot&aacute;. This file is more complete than grilla_bogota.csv because it includes the name of the Localidad in which the centroid of the cell belongs and its Rep. Rate. However, this file does not contain the rural area of the city.&nbsp;This file is created in the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/lgomezt/Modelling-underreported-crime/blob/main/Scripts/1_preprocess_data/3_create_grid.ipynb">3_create_grid.ipynb</a> script of our repository.</li>
	<li><strong>localidades.zip: </strong>this zipped folder contains the shapefiles to draw the map of Bogot&aacute; with its respective administrative limits.

	<li><strong>matriz_eventos_real.csv: </strong>is a matrix of 498 rows and 368 columns in which each row represents one cell of Bogota&#39;s grid and each column represents the number of <em>real </em>crimes for each date. Recall that we assume that the total of crimes is the combination of NUSE and SIEDCO crimes after the removal of duplicates.

	<li><strong>matriz_eventos_subreporte.csv:&nbsp;</strong>is a matrix of 498 rows and 368 columns in which each row represents one cell of Bogota&#39;s grid and each column represents the number of <em>subreported</em> crimes for each date. Recall that we assume that the number of sub-reported crimes is the number of crimes reported in NUSE.

	<li><strong>subreporte_ccb.csv: </strong>is a data frame of 498 rows and 4 columns that describe the Rep. Rate and lambda for each cell of Bogota&#39;s grid.&nbsp;This file is created in the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/lgomezt/Modelling-underreported-crime/blob/main/Scripts/1_preprocess_data/3_create_grid.ipynb">3_create_grid.ipynb</a> script of our repository.</li>

	<li><strong>victimizaci&oacute;n.xlsx:&nbsp;</strong>is an Excel file with 20 rows and 4 columns that contains&nbsp;the Vict. Rate and the Rep. Rate for each Localidad of Bogot&aacute;.
